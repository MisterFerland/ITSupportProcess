# ITSupportProcess
Support Toolkit
This Java application provides a support toolkit for various network and system administration tasks, designed with a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using Swing.

The toolkit includes the following features:

Clear DNS Cache: Clears the DNS cache on your system.

Kill Process: Allows you to terminate a specific process by name (e.g., notepad.exe).

Ping Address: Pings an address (e.g., 8.8.8.8) to check network connectivity.

Map Network Drive: Maps a network drive (e.g., Z:) to a specified network path.

Task Execution: Executes the selected tasks (DNS cache clearing, process killing, pinging, network drive mapping) and logs the results in the GUI.

Features:
Customizable input fields for process name, ping address, drive letter, and network path.

Output is displayed in a text area with logs and success messages.
